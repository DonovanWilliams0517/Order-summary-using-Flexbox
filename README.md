### What I learned
This project helped me better understand                    
Flexbox and was a good bit of a challenge and   
practice to get myself more familiarized with 
Flexbox

### Continued development

I definitley could use more work on my Flexbox and CSS but that's why I chose to take on this project. I feel like some of the things I do in CSS to reach my results are bad practice, so if I am doing it wrong or there's a more optimal way to do it, then I should be practicing those ways.
